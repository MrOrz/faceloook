Faceloook: Learning User Preferences on Facebook Feeds
======================================================



Faceloook is a browser extension that learns user preference on her/his own Facebook feed. Faceloook uses click events on each posts to distinguish the interesting posts from the others, collecting labels without userâ€™s cognitive effort. Naive Bayes classifier is used to create the user preference model out of contextual features of the posts and the click event labels.
